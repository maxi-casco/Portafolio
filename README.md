## üì¶ What is a Web Portfolio? 

A developer portfolio is a digital collection that showcases the work, skills, and projects of a programmer or software developer. It serves as a visual presentation of your technical and professional experience, highlighting completed projects, contributions to open source, skills in programming languages, frameworks and tools. A good portfolio can also include links to code repositories, project descriptions, case studies, and testimonials from clients or colleagues, making it easier for employers or potential clients to evaluate the developer's capabilities.
